## Quarto publishing process
Using the [Publshing Command](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command) process to publish the website. 

Command to publish is:

The website is published on GitHub Pages and is built on the gh-pages branch. All development is (currently) on main.

## Using Quarto
Use a Quarto document (.qmd) for each webpage.
